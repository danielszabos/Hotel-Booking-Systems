# Hotel-Booking-System
This software was designed to assist a hotel for managing bookings. It was created without the use of a GUI, however it is still functions. It uses basic logic to interact with the consumer. The functions consists of adding a booking with a date, storing that booking, calculating the total cost using cost/night * number of days, then displaying bookings when requested for the house count. Lastly, it validates data input and displays error messages accordingly. 
It was designed using an action chart and pseudo code. There have been 3 Java classes used with each of them serving a different purpose.
